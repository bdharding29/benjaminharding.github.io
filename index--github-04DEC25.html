          Proteins are molecular machines that drive nearly all cellular processes and a stronger understanding of their stucture, dynamics, and energetic landscapes serves as the foundation for protein engineering and novel ligand design. As a biophysicist, I leverage and develop experimental and computational methods for NMR spectroscopy to probe protein structure and dynamics.

        <p>
          I received my B.S. in biochemistry from Miami University (OH) where I developed an interest in membrane proteins and spectroscopy. I then completed my PhD at UW-Madison and the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM) where I developed experimental and computational solid-state NMR methods for the structure determiantion of the membrane protein EmrE under the supervision of Professor Chad Rienstra. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Hannah Wayment-Steele's lab where I am developing deep learning methods to predict protein dynamics using NMR relaxation dispersion.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          Broadly, I’m interested in how protein structure and dynamics encode biological 
          function, and how we can use AI to read that code more effectively. 
          I focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>High-throughput protein NMR:</strong> automating sample prep, data collection, 
            and analysis for families of related proteins and protein–ligand complexes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI for NMR data:</strong> CNNs and other models that classify chemical exchange 
            regimes, score simulated vs experimental spectra, and integrate with 
            modern protein structure predictors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Membrane and signaling proteins:</strong> using NMR to probe conformational 
            ensembles in challenging systems relevant to drug discovery.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Software / tools section (optional but very you) -->
      <section class="section">
        <h3>Software & Tools</h3>
        <p>
          I build open-source tools to link NMR data with simulation and machine learning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HSQC segmentation GUI:</strong> interactive segmentation and analysis of HSQC spectra, 
            with peak picking, patch extraction, and PDF/image export for ML.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spectrum–structure scoring:</strong> pipelines that simulate NMR spectra from 
            protein structures and compute quantitative similarity scores to experiments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ML training workflows:</strong> PyTorch-based scripts for training CNNs on NMR images 
            to classify exchange regimes (fast/int/slow/none) and other spectral features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          Code and documentation coming to GitHub as projects stabilize; reach out 
          if you’re interested in trying any of these tools.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I use experimental NMR, computation, and AI to study proteins that matter 
          for human health. Before and during my Ph.D., I’ve worked across NMR hardware, 
          pulse sequence implementation, data processing, and machine learning, 
          with an eye toward building practical tools that other scientists can use.
